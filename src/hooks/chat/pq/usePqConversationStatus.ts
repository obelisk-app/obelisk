/**
 * Conversation-level post-quantum status for an open DM thread.
 *
 * Returns `null` while the two attestation lookups are still in flight, so a
 * caller renders nothing rather than flashing "Not quantum-safe" at a
 * conversation that turns out to be secured. Both lookups go through
 * `getAttestation`'s stale-while-revalidate cache, so this is a cache read
 * on every thread open after the first.
 *
 * The resolved value is stamped with the inputs that produced it and compared
 * on read, so switching threads reads as "still resolving" without a
 * setState-in-effect reset that would cascade a render.
 *
 * Deliberately does not gate on the `postQuantumEnabled` preference here
 * (`conversationStatus` already folds it in), but a caller that wants to stay
 * silent for users who turned the feature off should check the preference
 * itself. See `DmPanel`.
