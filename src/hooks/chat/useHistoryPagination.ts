/**
 * Top-of-list history pagination with scroll anchoring - the "scroll up for
 * older messages" half of normal chat scrolling.
 *
 * ## Who moves the scroller
 *
 * Browsers implement CSS scroll anchoring: when content is inserted above the
 * viewport of a scroll container, the browser silently adds the inserted
 * height to `scrollTop` so the visible content stays put. Verified in
 * Chromium: prepending 1000px at `scrollTop: 400` leaves the container at
 * 1400 with no help from us - *except* at `scrollTop: 0`, where anchoring is
 * suppressed and the content visibly jumps. Safari implements no anchoring at
 * all. So neither "always correct" nor "never correct" is right, and a
 * correction that assumes the browser did nothing double-counts on the very
 * path this hook prefetches into (that regression threw the reader a full page
 * back into already-read messages on every load).
 *
 * This hook takes the ambiguity away: it sets `overflow-anchor: none` for the
 * duration of a page load, so the browser provably does not touch `scrollTop`,
 * then applies the one correction itself and hands anchoring back. Measuring
 * the anchor row in *content* space (invariant under scrolling) means a user
 * who keeps scrolling while the page is in flight keeps their scrolling -
 * the correction only ever adds the height that was prepended.
 *
 * ## What triggers a page
 *
 * User intent only: a scroll the hook didn't cause, a wheel, or a touch drag.
 * There is deliberately no "keep loading until the viewport is full" chain -
 * a page that fails to move the scroller out of the prefetch zone would
 * otherwise re-trigger itself, and 50 messages a round trip is a lot of relay
 * traffic and re-rendering to spend on a loop the user never asked for.
