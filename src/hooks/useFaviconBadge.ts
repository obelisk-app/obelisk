/**
 * Mirror the notification total into the browser tab: red dot on the
 * favicon + `(N) Obelisk` in the title. Should be mounted exactly once at
 * the chat root (currently from `ReadStateRoot`).
 *
 * **The badge counts things addressed to you - nothing else.** That is
 * unread DMs plus unread @-mentions on the relay you're connected to.
 * Ordinary channel traffic deliberately does NOT badge the tab: a busy
 * relay would otherwise pin the title at `(99+)` permanently and the
 * signal would mean nothing. Per-channel unread dots in the sidebar are
 * a separate, quieter affordance driven by `groupCursors`.
 *
 * Mentions are only counted for the active relay, because mention
 * scanning only happens there (CLAUDE.md, "Single-relay rule for
 * groups"). There is no background cross-relay mention watch.
 *
 * No "subtract the active channel" correction is needed here: the bridge
 * already refuses to push a mention card when `isUserWatchingChannel` is
 * true, so a mention you're looking at never enters the count. The
 * focus/visibility listener remains because that gate is evaluated at
 * ingest time and the DM half still reads live cursors.
