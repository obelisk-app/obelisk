 * Route-level error boundary for everything under the root layout - the

 *
 * Before this existed, a single render throw anywhere in the client tree
 * (a malformed event, a bad `nostr:` URI, an unparseable invoice) unmounted
 * the whole app and left Next's bare "Application error: a client-side
 * exception has occurred" screen, with a manual reload as the only way
 * back. Now the failure is contained and `reset()` re-renders the segment
 * without a full page load.
 *
 * The root layout keeps rendering around this, so the toast stack and
 * locale provider survive.
