/**
 * Buenos Aires Obelisco icon. Uses currentColor so it adapts to any theme.
 *
 * Traced from the shipped app icon (`public/icon-512.png`): a symmetric
 * silhouette with the slim left face cut out, so the background reads through
 * it exactly as it does in the icon and the favicon. The older
 * `public/obelisk.png` artwork this was previously traced from is deprecated:
 * both of its faces were solid and it sat ~8% wider at the base.
