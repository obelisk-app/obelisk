 * Attributes every message composer spreads onto its `<input>`.
 *
 * A bare, unnamed text input (especially a lone one inside a `<form>`,
 * which is what the desktop composer is) trips the heuristics password
 * managers and mobile keyboards use to spot credential fields. The result
 * is a chat box that offers to save a password, autofills a stored login,
 * or pops "Strong Password" over the conversation.
 *
 * There is no standard `autocomplete` token for "chat message", so this
 * works from both ends: name and type say what the field *is*, and the
 * vendor opt-out attributes say what it is *not*. Each `data-*` key below
 * is the documented ignore hook for one manager; they are mutually
 * unaware, so all four are needed to cover the common installs.
 *
 * `enterKeyHint` is here for the same reason: credential fields get a
 * "Go"/"Done" return key, message fields get "Send".
