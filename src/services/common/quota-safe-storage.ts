/**
 * Quota-safe `localStorage` adapter for Zustand `persist` stores.
 *
 * Why this exists: the bridgeCache (`obelisk-cache-v4/*`) swallows quota
 * errors silently, so it can fill the origin's ~5MB localStorage to the
 * brim without any symptom. Once it does, every *other* writer starts
 * throwing `QuotaExceededError`, most visibly the read-state store, which
 * persists on nearly every click (read cursors advance on channel/DM
 * focus). Those small per-account stores are exactly the state we can't
 * afford to lose, while the bridgeCache is by contract disposable
 * (stale-while-revalidate: the relay repopulates it).
 *
 * This adapter encodes that priority: on a failed write it evicts the
 * oldest bridgeCache entries via {@link cacheFreeSpaceForQuota} and
 * retries once. It never throws; if the retry also fails the in-memory
 * store stays live and persistence degrades until space frees up.
 *
 * Also owns the SSR fallback (in-memory Map) that the stores used to
 * inline individually.
