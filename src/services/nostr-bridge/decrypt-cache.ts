/**
 * Promise-coalescing memo for signer decrypt calls.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * A single inbound NIP-59 gift wrap is opened by three independent consumers:
 *
 *   1. `BridgeImpl.ingestIncomingGiftWrap`: the NIP-17 DM path.
 *   2. The groups-scope read-state sync (`read-state/relay-sync.ts`).
 *   3. The DM-scope read-state sync, once per relay in the NIP-65 union.
 *
 * Each opens the wrap layer *and* the seal layer, so one wrap cost up to six
 * signer round-trips, and on a remote signer (NIP-07 extension, NIP-46
 * bunker) a round-trip is the expensive part, not the crypto. None of the
 * three knows about the others, and each must apply its own verification
 * (`unwrapGiftWrap` checks the seal's signature; `unwrapForSelf` requires
 * self-authorship), so they cannot simply share a parsed result.
 *
 * Memoizing one layer down (at the decrypt call itself) fixes it without
 * touching any verification logic: all three consumers keep their own
 * checks, and the ciphertext they each hand the signer resolves from one
 * shared call. ~6 round-trips per wrap becomes ~2.
 *
 * ## Why the promise and not the value
 *
 * The three consumers fire *concurrently*: they are separate subscription
 * callbacks reacting to the same relay event. Caching only settled values
 * would miss every one of them, since none has resolved when the others
 * start. Storing the in-flight promise is what actually collapses the
 * fan-out.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * This is a fan-out collapser, not a persistent cache: a short TTL and a
 * small LRU. Surviving a reload is `wrap-ledger.ts`'s job. Entries hold
 * decrypted plaintext, so the cache is cleared on logout alongside the rest
 * of the per-identity state.
