/**

 * **This function never throws and never blocks a send.** A message that
 * cannot be quantum-secured still goes out; the conversation notice does the
 * teaching. That rule is in the spec and is non-negotiable, so every failure
 * mode here (no preference, no capability, no attestation, an unreachable
 * relay, a malformed attestation) collapses to the same `null`.
 *
 * Three conditions must all hold:
 *
 * 1. The `postQuantumEnabled` preference is on.
 * 2. `selfPqState().canSend`: the session can actually encrypt post-quantum.
 * 3. The peer publishes a *usable* kind:10203 attestation carrying a KEM key.
 *
 * On (2) we require `canSend`, not `canSend || capabilityUnknown`. Under
 * `capabilityUnknown` the extension publishes no `nip44.schemes` marker, so
 * post-quantum support is unobservable, and both ways it can go are bad:
 * an unaware extension silently ignores `nip44.encrypt`'s optional third
 * argument and returns classic ciphertext, which we would then record as
 * `pq: true` (a false security claim, the single worst outcome this feature
 * can produce), while a strict one throws, and throwing is what
 * `Nip46Signer` deliberately does rather than downgrade. Sending classic and
 * labelling it classic is honest in both worlds.
