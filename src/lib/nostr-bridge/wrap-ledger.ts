/**
 * Per-account ledger of NIP-59 gift wraps we have already opened.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * The kind-1059 subscriptions replay history on every connect: the DM wrap
 * sub asks for `limit: 200`, and the read-state subs ask with no limit at
 * all. Without a memory of what we've already opened, every page reload
 * re-decrypts the entire backlog — on a remote signer that is hundreds of
 * round-trips spent re-deriving state we already have on disk.
 *
 * `decrypt-cache.ts` collapses the concurrent fan-out *within* a session;
 * this is what survives the reload.
 *
 * ## Why it is scoped, not global
 *
 * Three consumers see every wrap and each wants a different subset:
 *
 *   | scope              | keeps                                       |
 *   |--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
 *   | `dm:inert`         | DM-inbox wraps that never reach a thread:   |
 *   |                    | call signals, unknown or unreadable kinds   |
 *   | `readstate:groups` | kind 30078 rumors, `d=obelisk:readstate:v1` |
 *   | `readstate:dms`    | kind 30078 rumors, `d=obelisk:dm-readstate:v1` |
 *
 * A single global "seen" set would let whichever consumer happened to reach
 * a replayed wrap first suppress it for the other two. Their subscriptions
 * are established at different moments against different relays, so that
 * order is not something we control. Each scope therefore tracks its own
 * progress — stored as a bitmask per wrap id so all three cost one entry,
 * not three.
 *
 * ## Why skipping is safe
 *
 * A wrap's effects are already persisted by the time we mark it seen:
 * read-state cursors are written to
 * the bridgeCache under `(relay, KIND_GIFT_WRAP, dTag)`, which
 * `subscribeAndIngest` re-seeds from on mount. Skipping the wrap does not
 * skip its outcome.
 *
 * **DM messages are the exception, and are never recorded.** Decrypted DMs
 * are deliberately kept in memory only (docs/direct-messages.md, "no DM
 * plaintext on disk"), so their wrap *is* the only way back to them after a
 * reload. The old `dm` scope recorded chat wraps as seen and so hid every
 * already-opened NIP-17 message after a page reload — only new ones showed.
 * `dm:inert` records only wraps with nothing to show; stored masks still
 * carry the old `dm` bit (1), which nothing reads any more.
 *
 * That invariant is why **`clearAllClientCacheExceptSession` must wipe this
 * ledger too** (see the `obelisk-wrap-ledger:` prefix in `cache-clear.ts`).
 * "Clear cache" removes the persisted cursors; a ledger that survived would
 * suppress the only events that could rebuild them.
 *
 * It also does not interfere with the rumor-level dedupe in `ingestDM`: the
 * recipient copy and the self copy of one DM are distinct *wrap* ids
 * carrying the same rumor id, so both still reach `ingestDM`, which dedupes
 * them exactly as before.
