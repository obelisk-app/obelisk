/**
 * Priority orchestrator — sequences the bridge's post-handshake REQ fan-out
 * into explicit tiers so the UI's paint order matches user-perceived priority:
 *
 *   P0  Channel menu (selected relay's group metadata) + own profile
 *   P1  Active channel content (messages, members, reactions) — fired by
 *       `setActiveGroup` and by `applyPendingResubscribe` with the active
 *       group bumped to the head of the queue. Not represented here as a
 *       static plan; it's stateful.
 *   P2  Everything else needed to bootstrap the rest of the app: layout-
 *       author seeding (relay-wide admin/member), DMs, contact list, mute
 *       list, authored-groups index, active SFU calls.
 *   P3  Lazy on first hook call: per-group admin/member, per-group
 *       reactions, per-pubkey kind:0 metadata. Owned by the bridge methods
 *       themselves (e.g. `useAdmins` mount → `subscribeAdminMember`).
 *
 * Why tiers, not just sequential dispatch: SimplePool batches outbound
 * frames within the current microtask. To get a strict "P0 frames hit the
 * wire before P2 frames" guarantee — and a relay's AUTH-gated queue
 * processes them in that order — P2 dispatch is deferred to the *next*
 * microtask. Cheap, observable in tests, no setTimeout flakes.
 *
 * Read-state relay-sync (kind 1059 subs) is NOT in this plan. It mounts
 * from `ReadStateRoot` and is gated on `groupMetadataEose` OR a 1000ms
 * post-`Connected` timer — see `docs/read-state.md`.
