/**
 * Priority queue in front of the remote signer (NIP-07 extension / NIP-46
 * bunker).
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * Every `window.nostr.*` call — `signEvent`, `nip04.*`, `nip44.*`, and the
 * `nostr-wot` extension's `wot.*` namespace — travels the same NIP-07 bridge:
 * page → `postMessage` → content script → `chrome.runtime` → MV3 service
 * worker. Extensions service that channel one request at a time, and an idle
 * MV3 worker adds a cold-start on top. Bunker has the same shape with worse
 * per-request cost: a full relay round-trip, sometimes a user approval prompt.
 *
 * The app produces far more background signer traffic than interactive
 * traffic — inbound gift-wrap decrypts, read-state unwrapping, WoT distance
 * lookups. Without ordering, a user pressing Enter on a message lands behind
 * hundreds of those, and the signature that should take one round-trip takes
 * seconds. Latency was `queue_depth × per_request_cost`.
 *
 * This module makes the depth *ours* instead of the signer's, so we can
 * reorder it.
 *
 * ## Design
 *
 * - **`MAX_IN_FLIGHT = 1`.** The signer is serial anyway, so holding one slot
 *   costs no throughput. It is also the whole point: once a request has been
 *   handed to the extension we cannot take it back, so the cap on in-flight
 *   background work *is* the cap on how long an arriving interactive request
 *   waits. With a cap of 1 it waits for at most one background round-trip.
 * - **Strict priority.** The `interactive` lane drains completely before
 *   `background`; FIFO within a lane. There is deliberately no aging /
 *   anti-starvation heuristic: interactive traffic is rare and bursty (a
 *   keystroke-to-send, a relay AUTH, a zap), so the background lane always
 *   gets the channel back within a few requests. Adding fairness here would
 *   trade the guarantee we actually want for one we don't need.
 * - **The slot is released in `finally`**, so a rejected op never wedges the
 *   drain.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * Only the `nip07` and `bunker` login methods route through here. `nsec` signs
 * and decrypts with local synchronous crypto — queueing it would add latency
 * to buy nothing. Callers keep their existing `if (loginMethod === 'nsec')`
 * early returns and wrap only the two remote branches.
 *
 * ## Lane assignment
 *
 * A lane is a property of the **call site**, not of the operation. The same
 * `nip44Decrypt` is background when it opens an inbound gift wrap and
 * interactive when it decrypts an NWC wallet response the user is waiting on.
 * Signer factories therefore take a lane parameter that **defaults to
 * `interactive`**, and only known-background call sites opt out. A new caller
 * that forgets to think about it gets prioritized, which is the safe failure.
