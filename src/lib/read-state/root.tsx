/**
 * Read-state mount point — owns the side-effects that wire encrypted
 * multi-device cursor sync (NIP-59 gift wraps) and the auto-mark-read +
 * favicon-badge hooks.
 *
 * Lives in `src/lib/read-state/` rather than `src/app/app/AppGate.tsx`
 * so AppGate stays a thin shell selector and the deferred-mount logic
 * is testable in isolation.
 *
 * Mount timing — Phase 5 of the data-system redesign:
 *
 * Relay-sync subscriptions (one `{kinds:[1059], '#p':[me]}` on the ACTIVE
 * relay for groups-scope state, one per NIP-65 read+write relay for DM-
 * scope state) are P2 priority. They MUST NOT block the channel-menu paint.
 *
 * Architectural rule: groups bind to the active relay only; only DMs and
 * DM-state sync run cross-relay. See CLAUDE.md and docs/data-system.md §4.
 * The {@link useReadyToSync} hook gates the two `useEffect`s on either:
 *   1. `groupMetadataEose === true` — the relay has finished streaming kind
 *      39000; channels are painted. OR
 *   2. 1000ms post-`Connected` — even on a relay that silently filters
 *      kind 39000 (no EOSE), we don't want to defer cursor sync forever.
 *
 * The 8s debounce in `relay-sync.ts:flush()` means a ~1s mount delay is
 * imperceptible to the user; cursor convergence across devices happens
 * after first paint either way.
 *
 * Account-scoped store ensures (read-state cursors, DM overrides, etc.)
 * remain eager — they read from localStorage and must be in place before
 * the chat UI tries to read cursors.
