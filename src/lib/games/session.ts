/**
 * Deterministic replay: an event log in, a board out.
 *
 * Every client runs this over the same relay-delivered kind 2390 events and
 * must land on the same `GameSession`. That agreement is the entire trust
 * model — see `protocol.ts` for why there is no referee.
 *
 * The ordering rules that make replay stable:
 *
 *   1. Events sort by `(created_at, id)`. `id` is a hash, so the tiebreak is
 *      total and identical everywhere — no "whoever the relay echoed first".
 *   2. A `move` is only applied when it comes from the player to move AND
 *      carries the current turn index `n`. A duplicate, a replay, or a move
 *      published against a stale view of the board fails one of those two
 *      tests and is dropped, so clock skew cannot reorder a match.
 *   3. Everything the engine rejects (`validateAction`) is dropped, silently.
 *      An opponent publishing an illegal cell has published noise.
 *
 * What replay cannot fix: a player who simply stops publishing. That is what
 * the turn clock is for — after `turnTimeoutS`, ANY participant may publish a
 * `timeout` for that turn, and because the deadline is derived from the log
 * (not from the claimant's clock), everyone else accepts or rejects the claim
 * identically.
