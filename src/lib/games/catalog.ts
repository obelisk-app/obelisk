/**
 * Display metadata for the games in the registry.

 * The registry knows the RULES; this knows what a game looks like in the UI:
 * its name, its one-line pitch, its thumbnail. Everything user-facing reads
 * from here and is keyed by `session.game`, so a table can never be labelled
 * as a different game than the one it is running. (It could, once: the card
 * and the modal both hardcoded "Chain Reaction", which made a Vesta table
 * look like a Chain Reaction table in chat.)
 *
 * It reads `game-meta.ts`, never an engine: a chat card or the picker can
 * name a game without downloading its rules (see `registry.ts`).
