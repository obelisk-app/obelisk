 * runs over the same relay-delivered event log (see `session.ts`).
 *
 * Rules an engine must hold to, or clients will disagree about the board:
 *   - no wall-clock reads, no randomness, no I/O;
 *   - never mutate the state it is handed: return a fresh object;
 *   - `applyAction` must be total for any input `validateAction` accepted.
 *
 * Lifecycle: waiting → in_progress → finished, or waiting → cancelled.
 * An engine ends the game by returning `nextTurn: null`.
