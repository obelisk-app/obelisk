# Relay layout & branding (operator-controlled, shared)

Two NIP-78 (kind 30078) replaceable parameterized events let admins control
what every user sees for a given relay:

- **Layout**: categories + channel ordering. `src/services/relay/channel-layout.ts`
- **Branding**: relay icon, banner, display name, description.
  `src/services/relay/relay-branding.ts`

Both accept one authoritative author: the validated NIP-11 operator identity.

Server media favorites use the same operator-author model, but they are stored as
NIP-51 `kind:30030` emoji-set events instead of NIP-78. See
[media-packs.md](media-packs.md).

## Storage

| What | Kind | d-tag |
|---|---|---|
| Layout | 30078 | `obelisk:layout:<relayUrl>` |
| Branding | 30078 | `obelisk:branding:<relayUrl>` |

Layout tags:

```
["category", catId, name, position]
["channel",  channelId, catId|"", position]
```

Branding tags: `["icon", url]`, `["banner", url]`, `["name", text]`,
`["description", text]`.

## Who can edit (the "authors" set)

The only pubkey accepted as authoritative for relay-wide settings is the
validated NIP-11 `contact` npub when present, falling back to the relay's
NIP-11 `pubkey`.

The sidebar gear is rendered only when the active identity matches that
operator key. Layout, branding, and server-media subscriptions use the same key, so
events from channel admins or unrelated pubkeys are ignored client-side.

## Security boundary

The client gate prevents accidental access and rejects untrusted display
settings, but it is not a substitute for relay authorization. NIP-29 member
and role commands are signed by the client and must be authorized by the
relay; a modified client can always attempt to publish them.

## Code map

```
src/services/relay/channel-layout.ts         subscribeLayout(relay, authors[], cb)
                                  publishLayout, applyLayout, relayOperatorAuthors
src/services/relay/relay-branding.ts         subscribeBranding(relay, authors[], cb)
                                  publishBranding
src/hooks/relay/                  useChannelLayout(relay, authors[]),
                                  useRelayBranding(relay, authors[]),
                                  useRelayRoles, useRelayEmojiSet,
                                  useRelayOperatorPubkey(relay)
src/app/[locale]/app/desktop/DesktopShell.tsx      Sidebar - gates the server settings gear
                                  and relay-wide modals
```

## Operator UX

1. Log in with the validated operator identity advertised by NIP-11.
2. Open `/app`, select the relay.
3. In the sidebar header, click the gear next to the connection dot.
4. Edit and **Publish**. The replaceable event lands on the relay; every
   client subscribed via `useChannelLayout` / `useRelayBranding` updates
   immediately.

If the gear does not appear, set NIP-11 `contact` to the operator npub (or
`pubkey` to the operator hex key) and reconnect.
