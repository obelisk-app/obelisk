# Voice — Overview

Obelisk has two voice engines that share one client surface
(`src/lib/voice/client.ts` → `VoiceClient`). UI components never see
which engine is active; they consume `VoiceClient` events.

| Engine | Topology | When | Code |
|---|---|---|---|
| **mesh** | P2P full mesh over WebRTC; signaling on Nostr (kinds 20078 + 25050) | small rooms (≤ 8), no SFU advertised on the channel | `src/lib/voice/{client,peer,transport,control-channel,discovery,failure-handlers}.ts` |
| **SFU** | mediasoup, Nostr-RPC signaling on kind 25050 envelopes | a kind 31313 advertisement is reachable (or pinned via `NEXT_PUBLIC_SFU_PUBKEY`) AND the channel is the `voice-sfu` kind | `src/lib/voice/{sfu-client,sfu-control,sfu-rpc,sfu-pin}.ts` (server lives in [obelisk-app/obelisk-sfu](https://github.com/obelisk-app/obelisk-sfu)) |

This directory documents the **mesh** engine in depth. SFU docs are at
[`../sfu-system.md`](../sfu-system.md).

## When to read what

- **[mesh-protocol.md](mesh-protocol.md)** — the wire protocol: presence
  beacons (kind 20078), signaling envelopes (kind 25050), perfect
  negotiation, transitive discovery, control-channel messages, hangup
  paths. Read this first if you're touching anything that produces or
  consumes Nostr events for voice.
- **[mesh-modules.md](mesh-modules.md)** — code map of
  `src/lib/voice/`. Read this before adding a new file or moving an
  existing one.
- **[failure-modes.md](failure-modes.md)** — every known failure mode
  and the handler it routes through, with the metric you'd watch in
  the `?debug=voice` overlay. Read this before opening a "voice
  doesn't work" issue.
- **[testing.md](testing.md)** — Playwright harness usage; how the
  two-peer / three-peer / glare specs run; how to add a new failure
  injection.
- **[diagnosis-2026-05-09.md](diagnosis-2026-05-09.md)** — Phase 1
  diagnostic findings. Useful as a pattern for future diagnostics.

## What "mesh" buys you

- **No central server**. The dex stays workable as long as one Nostr
  relay is reachable. There is no obelisk-owned voice server in the
  mesh path.
- **End-to-end encryption** of media via DTLS-SRTP — Nostr only carries
  signaling; the relay never sees audio.
- **Sub-10s hangup detection** as of Phase 3 (control-channel
  heartbeat). Pre-Phase-3 the only signal was ICE failure ~30 s+ after
  the peer vanished.
- **Transitive WebRTC discovery**: when A↔B and B↔C are connected,
  A and C learn about each other through B's data channel without
  needing the relay to deliver every beacon symmetrically. The mesh
  forms even on a flaky relay link.

## What mesh does NOT do

- Rooms larger than 5 participants. The mesh degrades quadratically
  (each peer maintains 4 outbound audio streams in a 5-person room
  → 20 PCs total). The 6th joiner is **actively rejected**: every
  in-cap peer sends a `bye { byeReason: 'room-full' }` so the joiner
  surfaces a clean "Room is full" error and leaves on its own
  without looping the reconnect ladder. Anything past 5 needs the
  SFU engine.
- Recording. There's no central party to record. If recording is a
  product requirement, route the room through the SFU.
- Ad-hoc "anyone can speak". Voice is gated by the channel's NIP-29
  member list — same trust gate as text chat.
