# Mesh - Code Map

`src/services/voice/` (a flat folder; its tests are under `tests/services/voice/`). This map names the main modules, not every file: most of the larger ones are split into smaller siblings with the same prefix (`mesh-*`, `peer-*`, `sfu-*`, `transport-*`, `client-*`).

## Public surface

- **`client.ts` → `VoiceClient`** - the one surface the app sees of a
  call. Owns join/leave and the topology choice (mesh ↔ SFU,
  `topology.ts`), and delegates the rest: `MeshSession` (beacons,
  discovery, one `Peer` per remote, signal routing), `SfuSession`,
  `LocalMedia`, `RoomState` (what the UI is told), `RoomMembership` and
  `ActiveCallWatcher`. Its REQs go through the bridge, and so through the
  relay hub. **Everything outside the voice/ folder imports through here.**
- **`active-client.ts`** - module-singleton holder so the chat UI's
  `getActiveVoiceClient()` returns the same instance the VoiceRoom
  mounted, even across route changes that re-mount React.
- **`jump-to-voice.ts`** - programmatic navigation helper used by the
  ProfilePopover "join their voice channel" button.

## Mesh internals

- **`peer.ts` → `Peer`** - one per remote pubkey. Adapts the established
  [`simple-peer`](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer) library to signed
  Nostr signaling, local media/quality policy, and the ordered control data
  channel. Lexicographic pubkey roles select exactly one initiator per pair;
  terminal failures return to `VoiceClient` for discovery-driven redial.
- **`transport.ts`** (with `transport-beacons.ts`, `transport-roster.ts`,
  `transport-signals.ts`) - thin Nostr layer on top of the bridge.
  - `publishPresenceBeacon(channelId, connectedTo, videoTracks)`
  - `subscribeRoster(channelId, onChange)`
  - `sendSignal(channelId, toPubkey, payload)`
  - `subscribeSignals(channelId, selfPubkey, onSignal)`
  - `transitiveParticipants(roster)` - derives the union of beacon
    publishers + their `p`-tag connectedTo lists.
- **`control-channel.ts`** - shared control message types and timing
  constants. `Peer` sends them through `simple-peer`'s ordered data channel:
  2.5 s ping, 20 s dead-peer timeout, 5 s peer snapshots,
  `hello`/`peerAdded`/`peerRemoved`/`bye`, and RTT measurement.
- **`discovery.ts` → `DiscoveryEngine`** - union of relay-derived
  and control-channel-derived peer sets. Keyed by `(pubkey, viaPeer)`
  for control claims; removal-when-no-claimants prevents flicker on
  partial partitions.
- **`failure-handlers.ts`** - small primitives:
  - `withRateLimitBackoff` - wraps publishes with exponential retry
    on rate-limit-shaped errors.
  - `installBeforeUnloadHandler` - synchronous tab-close goodbye.
- **`metrics.ts`** - `VoiceMetrics` interface + `emptyVoiceMetrics()`.
  Mounted on `VoiceClient.metrics`, mirrored to
  `window.__obeliskVoiceMetrics`.
- **`debug.ts`** - `pushVoiceDebug()` ring buffer (500 events) at
  `window.__obeliskVoiceDebug`. Read by the Playwright harness and
  the `?debug=voice` overlay.

## SFU internals (separate engine)

- **`sfu-client.ts` → `SfuClient`** - mediasoup-client wrapper that
  speaks the SFU's RPC envelopes over direct WebSocket.
- **`sfu-control.ts`** - `pickSfu()` resolves the SFU pubkey for a
  channel via per-channel pin, env override, or kind 31313
  advertisement.
- **`sfu-rpc.ts`** - direct authenticated WebSocket RPC framing with
  kind 25050 as an older-server fallback.
- **`sfu-pin.ts`** - validates an SFU URL via `/info` and stores the
  verified per-channel kind 30078 pin.

## Shared helpers

- **`types.ts`** - shared TS types (`VoicePresence`,
  `VoiceSignalPayload`, `VoiceTrackKind`, `VoiceQualityHint`,
  `VideoSlotKind`).
- **`stats.ts`** - `startStatsMonitor` for periodic
  `getStats()`-derived `QualitySample` events.
- **`quality.ts`** - `VIDEO_QUALITIES`, `MIC_CONSTRAINTS`,
  `AUDIO_MAX_BITRATE`.
- **`speaking-detector.ts`** - RMS threshold + holdoff for
  speaking-orb pulses. Shared AudioContext to avoid per-peer
  allocation.

## React surface

- **`src/components/voice/room/VoiceRoom.tsx`** - the main UI shell.
  Mounts `VoiceClient`, wires events to local state, renders tiles.
- **`src/components/voice/controls/VoiceControls.tsx`** - mic/cam/screen/leave
  toolbar.
- **`src/components/voice/status-bar/VoiceStatusBar.tsx`** - minimized "you're
  in a call" status pill.
- **`src/components/voice/room/DebugOverlay.tsx`** - `?debug=voice`
  diagnostic overlay (Phase 3).

## Hooks

- **`src/hooks/shell/panes/channel/useVoiceChatPane.ts`** - joint hook for the chat
  side panel that coordinates voice state with the chat tab.

## Module deferred from this round

The plan called for a `mesh/` + `sfu/` + `shared/` subdirectory split.
That's a purely mechanical reorganization that adds churn without
changing behavior; it can be done as a separate commit. The 300-line
rule has since split the folder into many more, smaller files, which
makes that split more worthwhile than it was.
