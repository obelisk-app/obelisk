# Games on the relay

Two games share one runtime: **Chain Reaction**, ported from the classic
centralized stack, and **Vesta**, consumed as a tracked upstream package. The
runtime itself is game-agnostic — a pure engine plus a replayed event log.

Chain Reaction was ported from the classic centralized stack
([obelisk-app/obelisk-classic](https://github.com/obelisk-app/obelisk-classic))
to the relay-only one. The rules are byte-for-byte the same engine; everything
that used to be a Postgres row and a socket.io broadcast is now a Nostr event
log.

## What changed from classic

| Classic | Here |
|---|---|
| `prisma.game` row holds `state`, `currentTurn`, `turnDeadline` | The **log is the state** — every client replays kind 2390 events through the engine |
| API route validates the move, then broadcasts the settled board | Every client validates every move independently; an illegal one is dropped everywhere |
| `setTimeout` on the server fires `onTimeout` | Any player publishes a `timeout` claim once the deadline has passed; the deadline is derived from the log, so everyone agrees whether the claim is good |
| socket.io rooms (`channel:`, `server:`, `pubkey:`) | one REQ per channel on the active relay |
| server assigns seats | the host's `start` event freezes the seat order |

The engine (`src/lib/games/chain-reaction.ts`) came over unmodified. That is
the point of the port: the game rules were already pure, so they moved without
a rewrite, and the only new code is the part that used to be a server.

## Wire format

One stored kind — `KIND_GAME = 2390` — carries every op. Modeled on the voice
signaling transport (`src/lib/voice/transport.ts`): plaintext signed events,
addressed by tags, gated in the handler rather than trusted from the relay.

Common tags:

```
["h", <channelId>]   NIP-29 group scoping — the relay's channel write policy IS the game's
["t", "obelisk-game"]
["op", <op>]
["e", <gameId>, "", "root"]   every op but `create`
["n", "<turnIndex>"]          moves and timeout claims
```

`gameId` is the `create` event's own id. Nothing else needs to be agreed on.

| op | content | published by | accepted when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create` | `{game, opts, turnTimeoutS}` | host | always; seats the host |
| `join` | `{}` | anyone in the channel | table is `waiting` and under `maxPlayers` |
| `start` | `{seats: [SeatSpec…]}` | host only | every seat's controller actually joined, count within min/max |
| `move` | `{n, action, seat?}` | the seat's controller | `n` is the current turn AND the engine validates the action |
| `timeout` | `{n}` | anyone | table has a clock, `n` is the current turn, and `created_at >= deadline` |
| `resign` | `{seat?}` | a seat's controller | table is in progress |
| `cancel` | `{}` | host only | table is `waiting` |

Unlike voice, this kind is **stored**: a spectator arriving at move 40 has to
be able to replay moves 1-39. Voice signaling can be ephemeral because SDP is
worthless a second later; a game log is the game.

## Determinism

`deriveSession` (`src/lib/games/session.ts`) is the whole trust model. Rules:

1. Events sort by `(created_at, id)`. The id is a hash, so the tiebreak is
   total and identical on every client — never "whoever the relay echoed
   first".
2. A move must come from the controller of the seat on move **and** carry the
   current sequence number. (Engines may allow specific out-of-turn actions —
   see `canAct` — but those are ordered by the same rule.) Duplicates, replays, and moves published against a stale board fail
   one of those tests, so clock skew cannot reorder a match.
3. Anything `validateAction` rejects is dropped. A client publishing an
   illegal cell has published noise.
4. Once a game is `finished` or `cancelled`, later events are inert.

A "waiting" table older than `WAITING_EXPIRY_MINUTES` (60) reads as cancelled.
That is derived from the clock, not published — no event, no signature, same
answer on any client whose clock is roughly right.

### What this does not defend against

- **A player who simply stops publishing.** That is what the turn clock is
  for. On a table created with `No clock`, a walk-away stalls the table
  forever — an accepted trade for a friendly game, not an oversight.
- **Collusion over the seat order.** The host picks it.
- **Privacy.** Moves are plaintext on a public relay, exactly like the chat
  messages next to them. A hidden-information game (poker, battleship) would
  need commit-reveal on top of this; Chain Reaction has no hidden state.

## Relay scope

Games follow the single-relay rule in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md): a table lives
on the channel's relay, because the channel does.

`subscribeChannelGames` asks `{ kinds:[2390], '#h':[channel], since, limit }`.
The `#h` is not free: a relay that doesn't index single-letter tags for an
unfamiliar kind answers a tag-filtered REQ with silence, and that failure looks
exactly like "nobody is playing" — which is why this filter was originally
kind + `since` alone, gating `h` in the handler. The cost of that was
downloading every game event on the relay for 24 hours on every channel visit,
mostly Stacker checkpoints carrying board and input blobs.

So when the tagged REQ produces nothing within `TAG_PROBE_MS`, a one-shot
`{ kinds:[2390], '#t':[GAME_TAG], limit: 1 }` asks the question that actually
distinguishes the two cases — same kind, same class of indexed tag, no channel
in it. If it returns something the relay can index these tags, the quiet channel
is genuinely quiet, and the wide filter never opens. If it returns nothing too,
the old relay-wide filter opens as the fallback and the relay is remembered as
needing it. Deciding on the tagged sub's silence alone would have re-opened the
firehose on every quiet channel, which is most of them.

`CHANNEL_GAME_LIMIT` returns the newest N events, so on a busy channel a
`create` can fall off the end. That is only acceptable because a card resolves
itself by id — see below.

## Resolving one table

The channel sub answers "what is live in here"; it is not how a specific card
gets its content. A `[[game:<id>]]` marker is an ordinary chat message, so
scrolling back past the 24-hour window used to leave a permanent skeleton.

`src/lib/games/resolve.ts` fetches a table directly, batching ids across cards:
`{ ids }` for the creates (a table's id *is* its create event's id, and exact-id
is the most universally indexed filter in nostr) plus
`{ kinds:[2390], '#e': ids, limit }` for the ops. Neither carries a `since`.
The two are disjoint — only ops carry an `e` tag — so no limit on the op filter
can starve a create, which is what guarantees a card always resolves to
something. Ids that come back empty retry at 4s and 12s, then stop.

## Where a card's content comes from

Three sources, fastest first:

1. **localStorage** (`src/lib/games/cache.ts`) — keyed per table, seeded in a
   layout effect so the skeleton commits but never paints. Checkpoints are
   omitted from the write entirely; stripping their blobs would be unsafe, not
   just lossy, because the store dedupes by event id and the stripped copy would
   permanently shadow the real one.
2. **The channel subscription**, above.
3. **The by-id resolver**, above.

And for the person who published: `publishResilient` ingests its own signed
event immediately (`echo`). That is not an optimistic guess — it is the same
event, with the same id, that everyone else will replay.

## Why replay is cheap now

`replayLog` takes an event log and nothing else — in particular, **not the wall
clock**. That is load-bearing: `selectSession` caches its result in a `WeakMap`
keyed by the identity of the log array, which is only sound while the output
depends on nothing but the log. The one time-dependent read (a waiting table
going stale after an hour) lives in `applyWaitingExpiry`, which runs on every
read and never mutates the cached replay. Reading the clock inside `replayLog`
would silently freeze every card on whatever the clock said the first time.

The log arrays are copy-on-write, so a new event produces a new array, a new
cache key, and one replay — for that table only. `useGameSession` subscribes to
`logs[gameId]`, not the whole map, so an event on one table no longer
re-renders and re-derives every card in the channel. Relay events land through
`src/lib/games/ingest.ts`, which batches a burst into one store update instead
of one per event.

## UI

- `/play` in a channel composer opens the table picker (frontend-only, like
  `/zap`). Creating publishes the `create` event, then posts a
  `[[game:<id>]]` marker as an ordinary chat message.
- `MessageContent` hoists that marker into a `GameCard`. The card is a
  pointer, not a snapshot: an hour-old message shows the match as it stands
  now.
- `GameModal` is the table — roster while waiting, board while playing.
  Every button publishes one event and then does nothing; the UI moves when
  the event is in the log. No optimistic board, because a board the relay
  hasn't accepted is a board the other players cannot see — but the publisher's
  own signed event goes into the log as soon as the relay confirms it, without a
  second round trip to hear it echoed back.
- Every client watching a table runs `useTurnClockEnforcer` and races to
  publish the timeout claim. The reducer accepts exactly one; the rest are
  harmless duplicates.

## Vesta

[fchurca/vesta](https://github.com/fchurca/vesta) — a settlement-building game
whose core module is already pure and log-shaped. It is a **tracked
dependency**, not a fork:

```json
"vesta": "github:fchurca/vesta#semver:^0"
```

`npm update vesta` pulls upstream's rule changes. Nothing in
`src/lib/games/vesta/` encodes a rule; it only translates vocabularies
(player index ↔ seat id, `move.player` ↔ who signed the event). Because the
package's `main` is `src/vesta.ts`, it is listed in `transpilePackages`
(next.config.ts) and inlined for Vitest.

Three things the relay forces that upstream's hot-seat client never needed:

**1. A move may not name its own player.** The seat comes from the signature.
Upstream had no reason to care — everyone shared a keyboard.

**2. Validation runs on every client.** Upstream splits `canBuildSettlement`
(the rules) from `placeSettlement` (does as it's told), and its UI calls the
guard first. Over a relay there is no UI in the path: a hostile client
publishes the move directly. So `checkRules` in `definition.ts` runs the
guards on every client for every move. Without it you could publish a
settlement onto an occupied vertex and everyone would agree you owned it.

**3. Dice cannot be self-reported.** `roll-dice` carries values upstream; we
ignore them and derive the roll from `entropy` — the id of the last accepted
event plus the turn index, both fixed before the roller published anything.
See `vesta/dice.ts`. The residual weakness is documented there: whoever
published the *previous* accepted event can grind it to steer the next roll.
Upstream's URD dependency (verifiable randomness) is the real fix, and
`dice.ts` is the single file that changes when it lands.

Vesta tables default to **no turn clock**. Our clock is per action, and a
Vesta turn is many actions (roll, build, trade, end), so a short timer would
guillotine people mid-thought. Timing out or resigning ends that seat's turn
rather than removing the player — Vesta has no elimination, and deleting a
player would rewrite everyone else's board.

### Seats, hot-seat, and remote players

A seat's identity stopped being a pubkey when Vesta arrived:

```json
["start", {"seats": [
  {"id": "<pubkey-a>",   "by": "<pubkey-a>", "label": "Ana"},
  {"id": "<pubkey-a>#1", "by": "<pubkey-a>", "label": "Beto"},
  {"id": "<pubkey-b>",   "by": "<pubkey-b>"}
]}]
```

`id` is what the engine sees as a player; `by` is who may publish its moves.
Two seats sharing a `by` are two people at one keyboard — Ana and Beto play
locally on Ana's machine, and their moves are signed by Ana's key. A move
names its seat when its signer holds more than one.

For an ordinary all-remote table `id === by`, so a Chain Reaction table reads
exactly as it did before seats existed — and a bare `["pk1","pk2"]` seat list
from an older client still parses (`parseSeats`).

The host can only seat people who joined: a seat whose `by` never published a
`join` is dropped. That stops a host dragging a bystander into a match.

### What lives here that upstream keeps in its UI

Vesta's client does real game sequencing between `applyMove` calls — it sets
`pendingSettlement`, flips `setupStep`, hands out second-round starting
resources, calls `nextTurn`, and decides when the robber may move. That is
fine for one browser with one player at a time. Over a relay there is no
shared client, so `sequence()` in `definition.ts` does all of it,
deterministically, on every replay.

The robber needs a flag that upstream keeps in the DOM ("a seven was rolled,
now place it"). Ours rides in the state under a namespaced `__obelisk` key,
because replay has to carry it — every one of upstream's reducers spreads the
previous state, so the field survives without touching their rules. A turn
cannot end while the robber is unplaced, and a steal is only legal once it
has landed.

### Resuming a saved game

Upstream exports `{startState, turns, endState}`. Passing that as
`opts.resume` on the `create` event starts the table from `endState` instead
of a fresh board (a serialized state is ~4 KB, comfortably inside one event).
`readResumeState` accepts a full record or a bare state.

### Playing it

`/play` opens the picker — every registered game with a thumbnail, its player
range, and its default clock — then that game's own options (board size for
Chain Reaction, seed or a loaded save for Vesta).

Names and icons come from `src/lib/games/catalog.ts`, keyed by game type.
Nothing user-facing hardcodes a game's name: the card and the modal both used
to say "Chain Reaction" outright, which made a Vesta table read as a Chain
Reaction table everywhere in chat.

Players join from the in-channel card; the host then hits Start, which opens
the seat assignment. There is one control per seat — **which account signs its
moves** — and everything follows from it:

- an account holding one seat plays it **remotely**, from their own client;
- an account holding several is playing them **on one machine**. They are
  still separate players with separate resources; they share a keyboard and a
  signature.

Seat order is turn order, and seats can be renamed. When the table resumes a
save, the rows are fixed to the saved players, in the save's order, each
showing the name it had — the host assigns each saved player to an account
rather than the mapping being implicit in row order.

The board highlights exactly the spots upstream's `getValidPositions` calls
legal, and every button is gated by the engine's own `validateAction` — a
rejected move over a relay is silent, so the UI never offers one.

## Stacker

Falling blocks with attacks — the multiplayer shape, where the lines you clear
bury somebody else. Named Stacker rather than the obvious thing because that
word is a trademark and this ships in a product.

It is the first **real-time** game here, and it does not fit the turn-based
runtime at all: there is no seat "to move", every board runs at once, and a
relay round-trip per input would make it feel terrible. So it splits the
difference:

| | where it lives |
|---|---|
| The board, gravity, input, 60 Hz loop | **local**, `stacker/engine.ts` + `useStackerLoop` |
| Attacks, top-outs, checkpoints | **on the relay**, kind 2390 |

`deriveSession` branches on `def.realtime` and builds a `session.match`
(`stacker/match.ts`) instead of a turn. Three new ops carry it:

| op | content | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `attack` | `{seat, target, lines, hole, nonce}` | garbage from one seat to another |
| `topout` | `{seat}` | that player is out; last one standing wins |
| `checkpoint` | `{seat, frame, attacksSent, linesCleared, stackHeight, inputs}` | progress, plus the input log that produced it |

### Why it stays honest

Everyone starts from the same seed, so everyone gets the same pieces in the
same order — a match is a race, not a lottery. The seed comes from the create
event's opts, or from the table id (a hash: unpredictable before the table
existed, identical for everyone after).

Because the engine is a pure function of `(seed, inputs)`, a checkpoint's input
log can be replayed against the shared seed to reproduce the sender's board and
the attacks they claimed. `verifyCheckpoint` does exactly that, and the UI
marks a seat whose claims its own log does not support.

**This detects cheating rather than preventing it.** Garbage lands before the
checkpoint that justifies it arrives, so a modified client can land one round
of unearned attacks before it is flagged. Preventing that outright means
lockstep — a relay round-trip per frame — which would destroy the thing the
game is for. The trade is deliberate. It also only catches invented attacks,
not a human being assisted by a bot that plays legitimately well.

Incoming garbage is fed through the same input log as everything else, so a
replay reproduces the board that actually happened, garbage included.

### Feel

The numbers that decide whether this plays well are all in `useStackerLoop`:
DAS 10 frames, ARR 2, gravity from 48 frames down to 4 as lines pile up, lock
delay 30 frames with 15 slide resets. The engine state is mutable and read
through `useSyncExternalStore` — copying a 400-cell grid immutably sixty times
a second is how a game like this ends up stuttering.

### Sound

Effects are synthesized at runtime in `stacker/audio.ts` — line clears pitched
by how many lines, a distinct chime for spins, garbage rumble, a falling
top-out. No asset files, and they fire straight off engine events.

The music is the `ncc`-prefixed set from
[TETRA](https://github.com/soyezequiel/tetris-para-luna-negra) by
**soyezequiel**, a La Crypta hackathon project. That repo marks its
royalty-free tracks with that prefix — see `ROYALTY_FREE_PREFIX` in its
`src/audio/music.ts` — and they were generated with Suno. All three ship under
`public/games/stacker/` and are credited in the game UI, linking back to the
source.

It just plays: the playlist is shuffled once per session and advances on its
own, with no picker. `MUSIC_TRACKS` in `audio.ts` is the whole catalogue —
adding or removing a file there is the entire job.

**The rest of that folder is not ours to ship.** It holds commercial
recordings — Duel of the Fates, The Final Countdown, a Bonnie Tyler cover,
orchestral Tetris theme recordings — and no prefix or folder makes those
redistributable. The `ncc` marker is the uploader's statement about their own
generated tracks, not a licence covering anybody else's. If you hold licences
for others, or the author confirms a specific file is their own original, add
that file to `MUSIC_TRACKS`.

If the track cannot load or the browser refuses autoplay, a generative synth
bed plays instead, so the game is never silent because of a missing file.

## Guides and screenshots

Each game has a public guide under `content/guides/{en,es}/` —
`chain-reaction`, `vesta`, `stacker` — with an animated SVG hero
(`src/components/guides/svg/`) and real screenshots of the running boards.

The screenshots are generated, not curated:

```bash
npm run dev          # a dev server has to be up
npm run snap-games   # → public/og/guides/games/*.png
```

`scripts/snap-game-shots.mjs` drives `/dev/game-shots` (a route that 404s in
production) with Playwright. That page mounts the real board components over
fixture *logs* — `src/app/dev/game-shots/fixtures.ts` builds kind 2390 events
and hands them to `deriveSession`, so the pictures are the shipped engine
rendering boards it derived, not mocked state. The Stacker table shot is
played live with scripted keystrokes. A rules change that alters a board
alters the guides the next time the script runs.

Guides reference the output with `<Shot name="…" />`, whose alt text and
intrinsic sizes live in `src/components/guides/Shot.tsx`; a shot named there
with no file on disk fails `Shot.test.tsx`.

## Adding another game

The runtime is game-agnostic. Port the engine from classic (`chess.ts`,
`tic-tac-toe.ts` are both already pure), make sure it obeys the contract in
`src/lib/games/types.ts` — no wall clock, no randomness, no mutation — and add
it to `src/lib/games/registry.ts`. Everything in `session.ts`, `transport.ts`,
and the store works unchanged; only the board component is new.
