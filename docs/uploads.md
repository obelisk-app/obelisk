# Uploads — storage layout and access model

## Storage

Uploaded files live on disk at `./uploads/<24-hex>.<ext>` relative to the
Node.js working directory. In Docker this is backed by a persistent volume
(see `docker-compose.yml`). The directory is intentionally **outside**
`public/` because Next.js indexes `public/` at build time and won't serve
files written there at runtime in production.

Files are served by a dedicated route handler at
`src/app/uploads/[name]/route.ts`, not by Next.js static file serving.

## URL format

Stored URLs in the database (emojis, GIFs, message content, etc.) are
**site-relative** (`/uploads/<name>.<ext>`) — never absolute.

Absolute URLs would bake the hostname at upload time, which breaks when:
- The server listens on `0.0.0.0` (not a routable client hostname)
- The domain changes (self-hosted migration, reverse-proxy swap)
- Clients load the app over a different scheme/port than the upload was made

If you see `https?://<host>/uploads/...` in the DB, it's legacy data — run
the backfill:

```sql
UPDATE "ServerEmoji"
   SET url = regexp_replace(url, '^https?://[^/]+/uploads/', '/uploads/')
 WHERE url ~ '^https?://[^/]+/uploads/';

UPDATE "Message"
   SET content = regexp_replace(content, 'https?://[^/\s)]+/uploads/', '/uploads/', 'g')
 WHERE content ~ 'https?://[^/\s)]+/uploads/';
```

## Access model — IMPORTANT

The `/uploads/<name>` route **does not check authentication**. Anyone who
knows a filename can fetch it.

### What this means

- **Unlisted, not private.** Filenames are `randomBytes(12).toString('hex')`
  = 96 bits of entropy, effectively unguessable. This is the same model as
  Discord/Slack CDN URLs.
- **URLs leak across server boundaries.** A user on Server A who posts an
  image exposes that URL to anyone who sees the message — including
  non-members, kicked users, embed crawlers (Telegram/Twitter/Slack link
  previews), and search engines that index any page linking the URL.
- **No per-server scoping at fetch time.** The uploads table doesn't record
  which server owns a file, and the route handler doesn't know either.
- **Kicked/banned users retain access** to any URL they already saw.

### When this is fine

- Emojis, avatars, server icons, GIF libraries — content that's *intended*
  to be shareable.
- Casual chat attachments in a context where the threat model matches
  Discord's (i.e. "nobody outside the server is going to find these URLs,
  and if they do, it's not a disaster").

### When this is NOT fine

- Anything resembling private documents, PII, or regulated content.
- Rooms or servers advertised as "private" where members would reasonably
  expect attachments to be inaccessible to non-members.

### If you need to lock this down

Two tiers, in increasing order of strictness:

1. **Session-gated** — require a logged-in session in
   `src/app/uploads/[name]/route.ts`. Cheap to implement, but breaks
   `<img src>` in contexts that don't carry the session cookie
   (cross-origin embeds, external link-preview crawlers, email clients).

2. **Server-scoped** — add a `serverId` column to an `Upload` table,
   populated at upload time, and check the viewer's membership in that
   server at fetch time. This is the "correct" model for private content
   but requires: schema migration, upload route persisting rows, fetch
   route doing a DB lookup per request (cache-friendly since filenames
   are immutable), and a strategy for emoji/avatar images that need to
   stay public.

Neither is implemented today. Status quo matches Discord's CDN model and
is acceptable for a Discord-like chat. Revisit if the threat model shifts.

## Size limits

Per-mime caps (bytes) live in `src/lib/attachments.ts`:

- Images: 10 MB
- Video: 50 MB
- Documents: 25 MB
- Audio: 25 MB

Servers can tighten these per-mime (but not loosen past the global
ceiling) via the admin panel. Custom emojis clamp tighter still
(256 KB static, 2 MB GIF) client-side; the GIF library clamps to 8 MB.
